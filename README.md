# VigurVM

A simple java virtual machine made for learning purposes.


## Goal and scope

The goal of this project is to be a simple to understand C++ implementation of a Java Virtual Machine, in order to learn more about Java and C++. 
(Because I haven't worked professionally with C++ yet.)

The goal is **not** to be reliable, fast, or memory efficient, or even feature complete.
Even though it is not set in stone, I will be trying to implement as much features as possible of JDK 8, in the free time that I have.
